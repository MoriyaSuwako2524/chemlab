This is a private reposity (Althou i'm glad if anyone can contribute to or benifit from this reposity).Focusing on *theoritical and computational chemistry* and *experimental organic chemistry* .
Currently I am working in the field of organic chemistry.
## Theoritical chemistry
I'm new to this field and learning about it.The major work i have done is not focusing on theoritical chemistry but it is intriguing.I finished several works listed below:
1. A Quantum Chemistry code that is able to solve multi-electron wavefunction within STO-3G basis set using restricted/unrestricted Hartree-Fock method.
2. Some simple computational bash that invoke Gaussian and ORCA.Mainly use bash and python(Dealing with text )

## Experimental chemistry
I'm now working on photochemistry and concentrating on *EDA strategy*.
This reposity consists of works below:
1. Some experimental tips that i've learned
2. Some experiments that failed
3. Some successful experiments.
